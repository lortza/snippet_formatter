# Snippet Formatter

Format snippets for your text editors in 1 place using Ruby. If you've ever changed text editors, you may recall the pain of having to rewrite all of your snippets into the new editor's format. Here, you can keep your snippets in 1 central place and then simply output them to the format you need. 

**Status: WIP**

## Supported Text Editors
- Atom
- Visual Studio Code
- WIP SublimeText3

## How it Works
1. Create an array of Ruby hashes
1. Run the generator for your specific text editor
1. Follow the output instructions to copy the generated files into that text editor's config
